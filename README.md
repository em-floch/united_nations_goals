# Exploration and prediction of global economic indicators

The goal of this project is to explore and try to predict future values of economic indicators that relate to 
the United Nations Sustainability goals. Understanding which indicators are linked and how they are predicted to grow is key 
to set action plan to reach these goals.   

## The process 

### Exploration 

The notebook data_exploration.ipynb contains the first data exploration steps including:

[x] Exploring the distributon of missing values across years, countries and indicators

[] Exploring the distribution of the data, summary statistics and outliers for the indicators we want to predict

[] Exploring the relationship between our key indictors and the others 

### Analysis

In order to predict some key indicators, I decided to 

[] Build a clustering method to identify sets of countries that are facing similar economic challenges 

[]

### Data 

The data used was provided by DrivenData, originally from the World Bank. (https://www.drivendata.org/)
It contains data from 1972 to 2007 about 214 countries and 1305 different indicators.
