# Exploration and prediction of global economic indicators

The goal of this project is to explore and try to predict future values of economic indicators that relate to 
the United Nations Sustainability goals. Understanding which indicators are linked and how they are predicted to grow is key 
to set action plan to reach these goals.   
The data comes from DrivenData, originally from the World Bank. (https://www.drivendata.org/)
It contains data from 1972 to 2007 about 214 countries and 1305 different indicators.
